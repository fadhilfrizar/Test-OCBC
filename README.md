### Technology Stack  
  
#### MVVM Architecture  

- **Model** is an interface responsible for the domain data (to be displayed or otherwise acted upon in the GUI)  
- **View** is responsible for the presentation layer (GUI)  
- **ViewModel** is the "middle-man" between Model and View. It reacts to the userâ€™s actions performed on the View, retrieves data from the Model, and formats it for display in the View
